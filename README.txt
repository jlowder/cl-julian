Lisp implementation of the functions described in 'Simple Formulae for Julian Day
Numbers and Calendar Dates' by Hatcher, D.A. 1984, Quarterly Journal of the Royal
Astronomical Society, vol 25 (http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1984QJRAS..25...53H).

This is the paper cited in "Numerical Recipes in C" for the julday routine, which
I've found to be very useful. I wanted to understand the math involved so I tracked
down the paper and implemented the functions in lisp so I could play with them at
the repl.
