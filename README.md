# cl-julian

Julian date conversion library

## Overview

This is a CL implementation of the functions described in [**Simple Formulae for Julian Day
Numbers and Calendar Dates**](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1984QJRAS..25...53H) by _Hatcher, D.A._ 1984, Quarterly Journal of the Royal Astronomical Society, vol 25.

This is the paper cited in "Numerical Recipes in C" for the julday routine, which
I have found to be very useful. I wanted to understand the math involved so I tracked
down the paper and implemented the functions in lisp so I could play with them at
the repl.
